        Chariot path is one of the most amazing hikes that I ever went on. Which is on top of a mountain range surrounded by a large grass land near Frotoft estate. The meaning of chariot path is a lane in which an airplane taken off. When it comes to this place it makes us confused why this place is called as chariot path, later on we got to know about a legend related to this place. It says that king Rawana took Sitha in his chariot to show the beauty of his kingdom along this path.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                 We gathered near Peradeniya town around 8 am and took a Nuwaraeliya bus, our intention was to find a way to Frotoft estate. It was around 10 when we got down from there bus at Pussellawa town. We talked with some locals in order to get some information about our destination and to get an idea about direction as well as the path of the journey.   
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    We were told that we have to take the bus to Pettraci and it is supposed to come to the bus stand around 11 am.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    We had enough time to buy the necessary things for our hike and our lunch packets from Pussellawa town. We bought everything from shop because we were in a doubt whether we will reach a town before our next stop.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    After that we came back to the bus station and bus arrived at 11 and it took off around 11.15 from the bus station. The road towards Frotoft estate through upper Ramboda estate was bumpy and rough. I guess it is not repaired for several years/ while enjoying this bumpy ride we talked with some locals in the bus and these were enough that you could ask directions to find the trail that takes you to the top of the summit. We got a little guidance from the conductor of that bus and he showed us the path towards our destination.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    After 2 hours of ride we arrived Frotoft estate around 1 pm. And it was very misty and gloomy due to the continuous rain. We put on out rain coats to protect from the light rain and we started to walk through the scenic tea estates. After walking nearly 1.5 km we reached the trail head at the border of the estate. Due to the weather the path to the summit was not clear and it was very slippery. So we had to be extra careful but it was not so difficult to keep in track. The last part was toughest because the road lying in a zig zag manner. We climbed continuously uphill until we reached the top of chariot path. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    The hike was nearly 1 and half hours. Unfortunately we weren't able to experience the best view due to the critical eliminate. All most all the mountains were covered with mist. And we all were drenched in rain. We waited these for some time and we had our lunch. Then we took the same path to climb town. It took us nearly half an hour to get back to the tea estate.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    If the weather was good we would be able to observe Adam's peak, mountain peaks at Rikillagaskada, knockels range and Mool oya estate as well as Kothmale valley.
